        title:"Bi-weekly mortgage",
        text:"A bi-weekly mortgage is a mortgage in which the borrower makes half of their monthly mortgage payment every two weeks, rather than paying the full payment amount once every month.  So if you paid monthly and your monthly mortgage payment was $1,000, then for a year you would make 12 payments of $1,000 each, for a total of $12,000.  But with a bi-weekly mortgage, you would make 26 payments of $500 each, for a total of $13,000 for the year.  This can help the borrower pay off their mortgage loan sooner and reduces the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.).",

The LTV compares the amount of a loan to the value of the asset being financed:  the amount you are borrowing divided by the price of the property being purchased or financed.  So the LTV is 66.66% on a $300,000 house where the amount being borrowed to purchase it is $200,000 (meaning the down payment is $100,000).  The lower your LTV the easier it will be to qualify for a mortgage loan.  For example, many conventional loans require that your LTV be no higher than 80%.  Of course, the greater your down payment amount, the better/higher your LTV will be.",

These features make an FHA loan particularly useful for many first-time homebuyers who have not yet saved enough for the amount of down payments that commercial lenders usually require for a conventional loan.",
